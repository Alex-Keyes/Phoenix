Environment

Dependencies: SDL2 for input and Qt5.3 for OpenGL and UI design.


Building
--------

Load the .pro file into Qt Creator. Compile. Copy a set of the latest cores from the libretro buildbot for your platform (http://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/) into a folder called "cores" in the directory the Phoenix executable resides. Copy /databases/systemdatabase.db into the directory the Phoenix executable resides. Everything should now run!
