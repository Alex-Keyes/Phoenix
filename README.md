Phoenix
=======

A super-slick libretro frontend powered by Qt5. Dead-simple to use, it features both a powerful library system to organize your game collection and a high-performance frontend to play them!

We've designed Phoenix with the hope that it'll be perfect for everyone, whether you're someone who hardly plays videogames, a hardcore gamer, a speedrunner, or even a homebrew programmer!

<b>Phoenix is still under early development. Don't expect everything to work!<b>
